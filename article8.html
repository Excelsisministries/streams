            <p> It's been a month and two weeks since I resumed school and I've finally fallen into a routine. Classes are stressful but OK and my roommates Sheila and Kathryn are not bad. Sheila is the life of the party while Kathryn on the other hand would rather spend all of the hours of her day in church. And lately she's been trying to make me come to church with her. It's not like I don't want to go, it's just that I was still trying to figure out where I stand with God, she says God loves me, my dad tells me that too. I'm trying so hard to believe that but if He is Supreme and He says He loves me then why couldn't He save my mother or help my father. 
</p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/love.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>I hear my phone ring from the corner where it is charging. I rush to pick the call and realize it's an unknown number. <br>
"Hello good afternoon, this is Jumoke speaking how may I help you?" I say. <br>
I'm surprised when I hear it's Elvis calling. I haven't heard from him since I got off that bus and being the first one to call would have been the last thing I'd ever do. <br>
He explained to me that he planned to call me when he got home but he had an emergency at the office so he got back really late and since then, it's been work all through. Then he goes further to tell me that he has a birthday coming up on Friday that he'd really love for me to attend and that I shouldn't worry about transportation he'd send his driver to come pick me up. We share our goodbyes and the line goes dead. 
<br>
It's Friday morning, today is Elvis birthday and I'm supposed to meet him at his birthday party. I tell my roommates; Sheila thinks I should go, but Kathryn thinks I should decline. I don't plan to decline though. It's just a birthday party. It's not like he is asking me to go on a trip with him or something.<br>

It's 12 pm and I go to meet the driver at the gate. I find him already waiting for me. I greet him and tell him I would like to make a quick stop to get a present for Elvis as I wouldn't want to go empty handed. <br>
On getting to the venue, I realized that the party was not at all what I had expected. It wasn't in his house like I thought it would, rather it was in a suite and the guests weren't at all plenty. It seemed more like multiple dates than a birthday party, just Elvis and two other of this friend's and their dates and of course myself. I was starting to get uncomfortable. I sighted Elvis approach me. As he leans in to hug me, I can smell alcohol on him. He had been drinking and it smelt like a strong drink. I didn't feel safe anymore. But I had no choice, I didn't drive myself and it's a really far distance back to school. <br>

"Happy birthday Elvis, I got you something" I say as I proceed to give him the gift I had picked out.<br>
"Oh thanks beautiful, you shouldn't have" <br>
"Ohby the way, you look stunning" he replies as his hand sneaks round my waist. A blush crept my face. He led me to meet the others and introduced me. I watch as his guys smile mischievously. I fight the urge to read meaning to their action. Halfway through the evening, he tells me to have a drink, I'm reluctant because everything around is alcoholic. I've had alcohol before though, but right now I don't know if I can trust myself under the influence with an almost drunk Elvis. After much persuasion, I give in. Not long after, my senses dull a bit. Not that I mind, it makes me a little bit more comfortable to go through the night. I believe Elvis notices this too because he becomes more touchy. Every time he does, I find a way to escape his hands. Not long after, his friends announce that they need to leave. That's when I check the time and realize it's already 9:30pm and I cannot make it back to school in time. My school gate closes by 10pm and it's a 2 hours journey from here. I begin to panic. Elvis tries to calm me down, telling me that I can spend the night and he'd tell the driver to take me to school, first thing in the morning. He goes further to reassure me that I shouldn't be scared that he won't sleep in the same room with me. I relax a bit at his reassurance, and go into the room that I would stay for the night. Minutes later, Elvis comes with a cup of water telling me it'll help me clear the alcohol from my system. I drink the water, moments later, I realized that I'm not myself anymore, I try to move my body, but I feel really heavy, I try to shout but I cannot hear myself, I see Eric come back into the room, and rape me. <br>

**********************************************************************************<br>
Two months since I walked back into my room feeling filthy and dead on the inside. My roommates have been trying to find out what happened that day, but have long lost hope seeing that I shut everyone out. I can see the questions on their face everytime they look at me. Thinking about it alone, breaks my heart. I'm not about to have that conversation with anyone, especially not Kathryn. I wouldn't want anyone telling me I'm filthy and condemned,  I was aware of that. <br>
How could I have been so stupid? How could I have trusted Elvis? The fact that he blackmailed me breaks my heart even more. Telling me that if I say anything about it he'd release the video and obviously he's completely covered in it. The last thing I want is the whole world seeing me as an object of pity.<br>

It's a weekday, yet I'm in my hostel on bed. I've not been feeling like going to classes lately. The last thing I want is to be around people, especially those with so many reasons to smile. I honestly wonder what makes them so happy. <br>
I am brought back to reality as I hear the sound of the door unlock. As I turn, I see Kathryn walk towards me.
<br>
"Hey, you're not in school" she says. I ignore her, not interested in anything she had to say. <br>
I'm shocked at the next words I hear <br>
"He raped you didn't he?"<br>
 For a second or two, I forget how to breathe. I stay silent for loss of words to say to her. Then she continues speaking; 
" You know, God showed it to me in a dream. He's trying to reach out to you. He says; come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I'd give you rest." <br>
"No person should carry that much burden alone". "Jesus loves you, I know it's hard to believe but...." <br>
"Get out!" I say deciding that I'd had enough of what she had to say. <br>
She stands from my bed and turns to leave, not before she says; "Trust me, I know how broken you feel" and walks out.
Now again, I'm lost in thoughts.  This time, they're thoughts of Kathryn and all that she said. I begin to think that I was too harsh on her. All she tried to do was care after all. I decide that one day I'd apologize to her, just not now. What did she mean when she said she understood? Surely she had not been raped or gone through half of what I have, otherwise she wouldn't be so happy. Concluding that it was just something she was trained to say to cheer people up, I fall into a restless sleep.<br>

Something weird is definitely going on. How can I have similar dreams one week straight? In every one, there's a man giving Kathryn a letter to give me. The one that struck me the most was the one I had today. In the dream, I'm in chains, I see the same man, comforting me and telling me that the keys to my release he had given to Kathryn, I needed her to assist me to get through the door. I woke up determined to talk to Kathryn today. If not for anything, at least so I could get my beauty sleep back.
Just then, I see her enter the room.<br>
"Hey Kath. Can we talk?"  I say. <br>
"Sure" she replies as she comes to sit beside me on my bed.<br>
I start to apologize to her about the other day, before she stops me, telling me she wasn't mad at me as she understood I was going through a lot.<br>
I go ahead to tell her the series of dreams I've been having lately and what she thinks. And finally what she meant when she said she knew how I felt.<br>
After a long pause, she begins to tell me that she doesn't really know what she is supposed to give to me but that she believes God is trying to reach out to me. Then she begins to tell me the most pathetic story I've ever heard. The shocking thing is; it was hers.<br>
She tells me how a lot of people think she comes from a well to do family, and was born with a silver spoon. She was born out of wedlock, her mum raised her alone till she was 7 years old, then her mother decided to marry a man she fell in love with. The man was divorced and had a 16 year old son. The man didn't really like her but accepted her as a baggage that came with the woman he fell in love with. They moved in with the man, and not long after, his son began to molest her. He threatened to kill her if she reported to her mum. This lasted for a few months, till she summoned the courage to tell her mum about it. Her mother and her husband didn't take it lightly, she even accused her of lying to scatter her marriage and called her a witch. That night, she ran away from home and stayed on the streets till she saw a woman approach her. The woman owned an orphanage and asked to take her in. Most of the days that followed, she spent them crying and asking God why he hated her so much. She was withdrawn and did not make friends with anyone. Then one day, a couple came and asked to adopt her. Those are the people they call her parents now. Although she wanted a family, she was terrified. What would it be like? Would they maltreat her? Also, they had an older son in his early twenties. Would he rape her too?<br>
She says looking back, she is glad she was adopted by her parents. Nothing she thought would happen, happened.  Her elder brother is her closest friend, he led her to Christ and made her embrace his love for her.  Knowing Christ helped her heal, it helped her let go of hurt and anger and helped her forgive her mother and her mother's new found family. She said Jesus had given her the grace to love these people that have loved her ever so dearly. She knew Jesus loved her and nothing could change that.<br>

As she completes the story, I find that I've been crying. If all that she says is true, if her life had really been that difficult and yet Jesus brought her peace and joy, then I wouldn't mind knowing him too. I wouldn't mind having this rest she speaks of.  Could he really take away this bitterness and pain? I was raped, what if he thinks I'm defiled already. You know they say he is pure and holy, but she was raped too and not even once. If he still loves her, surely he would love me right? How about my mother? If he really loved me, why would he let her.....<br>
A slight ache in my head breaks me from my train of thoughts as I realize I've been trying to process too many sentences all at once.<br>
Then the words unexpectedly left my mouth;<br>
"How do I know this Jesus?"<br>
Hearing those words, Kathryn smiles and hugs me.  "All you need to do is open your heart and say yes to him, you'd find he's already waiting for you".<br>

**********************************************************************************<br>
Hi I'm Jumoke, and I'm a Christian. A couple of months ago, I'd have told you how much I hate God. Today I tell you a different story. That there's a God who loves you so much that he readily gave his son to die for your sins. The words that I write, he taught me through his words, that we who labor and are heavy laden should come find rest in him. 
He says in Psalms 147:3 “that he healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds”. That’s exactly what he has done with me.<br>
I've learnt that life is uncertain, but peace is found in Christ. For even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I would not fear because he is with me, and guides me ever so dearly.<br>
So if you're out there, going through all of this or worse, I pray these words reach you in due time and they bring you strength and peace.<br>
Jesus loves you.
