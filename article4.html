            <p>Dearly beloved, these seem like words but I want you to imagine yourself at the bank of a beautiful river.  Allow it overflow you. Perhaps at other rivers, you have stood at the banks, uncertain, wondering if this is for you. A part of you aches to reject it even, convincing you that you've not suffered enough for the defects in your character or the heights that God wants to take you too. This is why you need to not just take a wary look at this river or gulp down just one cup but allow it overwhelm you to the point of losing control. It needs to permeate very part of your being and soak you until you are not the same again. It's consists of very bold waves that even I was terrified of exploring but I'll urge you to lose yourself in this river, move beyond the ankle level, dare to move beyond the knee too, come over to where you can no longer swim. I really love you and want you to find the freedom and healing that soaking in this particular river will give you.</p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/way.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>Have you ever heard the phrase, "I love you just the way you are"? Many times when we hear this phrase, we often smile politely but withdraw into our fortress of unbelief, sometimes indifference as we reflect on how great such a "sacrifice" must be. We probably feel like, "Every time, I try to act better than the last time. I try to behave in a way that guarantees peace but it's no use, I fall short. So somehow I've come to resent people's love for me because the more overwhelming it is, the more I realize that it's a sacrifice to love me. Oh what a mighty, great sacrifice and so most times I want them to be free of it. " <br>
 Do you often want God to be "free of you", do you feel like it's costing him to love you so much, do you feel like it's such a huge weight on him and your lack of change wearies him. Do you feel like your progression is so slow he must be exasperated with you? Do you feel like He'd rather you hurried up and became a better person at once, do you often wonder when he'll throw up his hand and proclaim," You're no good, I've given you so much time". If your answer to these question is yes, or some of these questions, or even one of these questions. I'll urge you to rest in the first wave of this river and never ever forget it. God doesn't consider it a sacrifice to love you." It's true that he paid a huge sacrifice to purchase you and reconcile you to himself, but he loved you before he paid that sacrifice, while he paid it and most definitely after he paid it. This is what scripture tells us about when it says, 
" But God shows and clearly proves His [own] love for us by the fact that while we were still sinners, Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) died for us."
Romans 5 v 8.Amplified<br>
You are worthy of God's love because of Jesus and only because of Him, you couldn't and will never be able to get it because you finally became perfect. You'll not even be worthy of it because you attained the perfection. Nope. Not even then. So you might as well stop trying to put in your "contribution". It's not needed because your bill has been fully paid. It is in fact an insult to try to pay for something that you receive as a gift. So that's settled. I couldn't do anything to make myself worthy. But Jesus could and most importantly, He did. I'm not worthy because I'm a virgin or because I'm a minister's daughter, I'm not worthy because I do not smoke. I'm worthy because Jesus died to make me. Because of Jesus, I am now worthy and in fact because he cleared it with the father, I now deserve it. Am I saying it is no longer a gift? Never! It was the extravagance of God's generosity that gave us Jesus in the first place. It will always be a gift, a loving gift by a loving father and we receive it wholly. 
So now we've settled that we are worthy of God's love because Jesus is. So the sacrifice was huge and costly, why on earth do you think that Abba would make such a lofty investment? To inherit a bunch of failures?To nurture a bunch of depraved people? I think not. But don't take my word for it. Take Abba's. 
"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light." 1 Pet 2 v 9.KJV.<br>
In that scripture, you see Abba's perception of you, in his description, you see two things. What he made you (what you have become) and what he stands to gain for making you. You are the loved child of a loved God. You are not loved because of what you can do but you most definitely have been given the capacity to DO. Abba did not send his son to die for a worthless piece of junk that would remain worthless after receiving Him. He sent his son to die for a worthless piece of junk that becomes an asset of inestimable value when you receive his life. You are not worthless. So you see why He's hopeful? You see why he cannot see it as a sacrifice to love you?  It is true that he takes a lot to mould a man into greatness, but whilst moulding the man, the expression on his face is joy, love, peace and endurance not exasperation and disgust for being ladled with such a responsibility. Abba derives pleasure in pruning you even when it is painful for you, not because he is mean but because He is love and He won't want you to be anything less than He is. <br>
You need to understand that He has promised to never be angry with you again, not because you are good but because you are in his beloved son. Does he discipline you? Oh yes, does your conscience "deal with you" oh yes, does he take away things that you love but won't help you? Oh yes, Because he's loving but never because he is angry with you. He loves to love. And He loves to do it every day. There's never a time it's a struggle, there's never a time it's a hard decision, there's never a time He'd rather not. He'd also want. 
 Beloved in the son, rest in this. Abba does not consider it a sacrifice to love you. He considers it a joy. To him you are delightful; you are his Hephzibah, His virgin bride. His eyes see you purely and desire you. Even when you think you don't deserve it. A healthy prayer life will keep you in the centre of God's works but it doesn't give you a place in the centre of his heart. You were already there. Don't ever forget that He loves you, just the way you are.
