            <p>The sun bloomed on a Sunday afternoon, where all the youths and teenagers of the area headquarter of my church gathered after church service to rehearse for our interdenominational carol, an annual programme held by the area headquarter every December.
As a timid young girl with a timid brother, I really found it difficult to be retentive in such a gathering, where vibrant youths and teenagers stood and sat in comfort to rehearse the song to be presented for the carol. While my eyes dashed to and fro, searching for whom to copy the lyrics of the song from, Nelson, my sister's ex-boyfriend who quite know my timid disposition approached me.<br>
"Hello Jennifer, I see you're really going to Miss Rita"<br>
Rita my elder sister just gained admission into the polytechnic and had left for school two weeks before the Sunday.
"Good afternoon Bro Nelson" I said and smiled shyly.<br>
"Don't worry! From now on, you and Nathan are my responsibilities now...Take my note and write the lyrics of the song"   He talked using an empathetic tone.<br>
I got his note, called my brother Nathan to pen down the lyrics too.<br>
The clock went round swiftly, as we closed the rehearsal and everyone left for their houses. Nathan and I took the root to our house and met bro Nelson on our way.<br>
"Jenny and Nathan! I met you two? See how you can walk fast" He said jeeringly.<br>
Nathan and I looked, smiling though to exchange gestures with him.<br>
"Oya, lemme escort you" 
He held my hand as we walked together. Bro Nelson escorted us till we got to a close path that led to our house.
He cautioned us as if he was going to be accountable for our wellbeing.
 "Take care of yourselves and be good"
I displayed an expression by grinning and said "Thank you so much bro Nelson"
"It's fine. Bye!"  He replied.<br>
He left as Nathan and I looked forward to reach our house.<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *******************************************************</p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/fail.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>

Moment went and approached as I learnt and began to relate with bro Nelson informally. The act of volunteering to be a lesson coach for my WAEC exams, paved the way for me to really relate close with him. We had mostly met in church, talked and played so casually. We related with each other until we became bosom buddies. I practically and if not almost poured out my whole being to him. I trusted him and believed that he was worthy of all the accolades I could ever give a person of high esteem.<br>
Oh yes! This was exactly what he started to look like the moment we started relating closely. He was really attractive in and out.  I mean, he was a Christian, god-fearing, intelligent and wise. What more could I ever ask from a friend than all these? In fact, knowing that he was a Christian, was satisfying to me.
I respected him so well and could do anything to please him. Although, I wasn't conscious of him reciprocating all these gestures of mine, plus, I was oblivious that our relationship could just seem to be a senior brother and younger sister relationship to him.<br>
As our relationship went farther, my heart began to melt anytime I met him. I just gradually became out of myself when I set my eyes on him. My heart gonged as I really felt uneasy to act normally. I was so mindful of his attention, reaction and movement anytime he was around where I was. Even at the times when scenarios would want me to act like the normal Jenny, I would always say to myself "Common Jenny! Nelson is here".<br>
Lolllll! All of a sudden, I started calling him by his direct name in my crippled mind for one reason that was difficult to admit.<br>
I personally couldn't deny the fact that he was now looking like more than a senior brother to me. So, I just managed to tell myself the truth by first asking myself questions and answering them too.
"Girl, don't tell me you're in love with this guy?"<br>
"Common! You can't be in love with your sister's ex na." 
"Haba! That's unfair! Someone that broke up with your elder sister? No Jenny! Better shut these crappy feelings of yours... Besides, you remember how you use to condemn this guy before your sister?"<br>
While Nelson and Rita were still dating, I hated him for no reason. I couldn't just justify the essence of my hatred for him and then he broke up with my sister again, leaving her in pain, regret and anger. It increased my hatred for him. However, the issue got settled as my sister moved on, got matured intellectually till they met each other again, talked one on one and became ordinary friends. I accepted and allowed the scenario pass up to the time he came to become my church member and then this.<br>
"I can't have feelings for Nelson na! What will my sister take me for?"<br>
I consciously said to myself, expressing funny looks.<br>

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ****************************************************<br>
A night of so much shock arrived for me, because it spelled out the unusual that started at that stage of my life.
We had our weekly Tuesday programme at church and had closed already. I could never have believed that Nelson was fully aware that I had something more than a younger sister's love for him so fast. Amazingly, he was aware because he was matured enough to comprehend gestures.<br>
That night, I got back from church, took my bath, ate and went directly to where my phone was plugged in the sitting room. I laid on the floor and began to glance through the offline messages on my Whatsapp media. As usual, Nelson and I began to chat, up until it got to the dicey place that I said the words I promised myself not to declare at a particular stage of my life. This started when Nelson asked me the casual question<br>
 "What’s on your mind?" <br>
I told him a few things about how my day went and then he proceeded by asking again what more was on my mind. 
"You can tell me anything tonight! I'm in the mood."  He replied sending a smiley emoji.
 To lengthen our conversation, I replied, "There's really more but it's not necessary to be shared with anyone"
"Why?" He asked.<br>
"Never mind, bro Nelson!" I replied even though my heart already bumped. I was partially excited. I melted more because I had agreed that I was really in love with him and could not trade him for anything, not even for my happiness. I ignorantly felt he was one of my core happiness and one that would make me live a life in fast lane. 
 What a fake reality indeed!<br>
I, in blindness saw my world around him, but was scared to let out my feelings to him orally.
I had once made a rigid decision as I thought it would be, not to ever propose to a guy first or tell a guy that I love him first before he does that to me. I made this decision since I broke down emotionally in secondary school because I immaturely played with my feelings. I had a crush in my class named David. I liked him and thought he did too. Only to finally know that he was interested in another girl in the class. I was pieced badly inside because my heart was too young and fragile to be tampered with like that. It was my fault though to ignorantly engage in that which I wasn't prepared for. I finally moved on when we got separated in SS2 because I left for another school to write WAEC.<br>


* * * * * * * * * * *********************************************************************<br>
I got pestered that night by Nelson. But, I disciplined myself till the next day as I didn't say anything about my feelings for him. He insisted and even jokingly threatened to dismiss our relationship if I didn't tell him.
Apparently, he was suspicious already and was expecting me to tell him exactly what was on my mind. I struggled to refuse and so I received his message again.<br>
"You want to tell me that you have feelings for me right?"
Immediately I got this, the beat of my heart increased in sound. I went offline immediately without replying.
My inner being was anxious. I didn't know what to do. I just noticed that I was kind of excited and still worried.
I don't know. There was just something good and bad about that present situation.
I came online again to see his message.<br>
"Tell me Jenny" He said after waiting for two minutes for my response.<br>
I sighed, summoned courage and asked myself "But, is it even bad to date your sister's ex?  At least they are not dating again"<br>
My mind had gone beyond just falling in love with him to dating him already.<br>
So, I replied him "Yes!"<br>
"It's fine my dear. But, you know this is not possible... You're like a sister to me"
He replied sounding like an elder brother truly.<br>
"Abba Father!" I exclaimed.<br>
I felt ashamed of myself instantly.<br>
"Oh Jenny, what have you done?"<br>
My heart staggered and was troubled.<br>
As if he could read my present feelings, he replied "Hey, don't you dare try to blame yourself for saying this....in fact, can you come to my house?... Let's talk more on this!"<br>
"Wow! Come to your house! I cannot do that.... This guy just wants to make matter worse for me" I said to myself and then replied him" No! I can't, I'm sorry."<br>
"Jenny! Look, I know you will be feeling uneasy now. I understand that feeling....But, I really need you to come to my house... We need to talk" He replied.<br>

In sobriety, I responded “I’m sorry bro Nelson, I can't... please understand"<br>
"Jenny! You know me. I don't bother people about anything. But, I'm requesting again that you come to my house....you should know that this really mean a lot to me" He responded again in a more serious tone.
 I sighed and then decided that I was going to meet, at least to show him some respect.<br>
"Okay! What time?"  I asked.
"12pm is fine. I'm not busy." He replied.<br>
While I began to imagine how I'd be able to stand before him, look him in the eyes and converse with him, I replied his message   "Alright, I'll be there"<br>
"Hey! Have I not embarrassed myself?"  I asked myself, still anxious of what was going to happen next when I see him.<br>
It was still 9am. So, I did the needful like my house chores, cooked, hanged out with my friends for a while to calm myself down. I prepared to leave for his house and purposely left my house late. I left my house as at 12:10pm and got to his house almost 1pm. <br>
He lives upstairs. So, I called him that I was already in his compound and waited for him to come downstairs.
My heart started raging sounds that weren't melodious.<br>
Here comes Nelson!!!<br>
I looked down immediately I sighted that he was approaching me.
"Look at you, so this is your own 12pm?" He said jokingly, twisting my nose.
I raised my face slowly and replied "I'm sorry"
"I'm sorry" he mimicked me.<br>
We walked together as he humbly got me a chair to sit.
I sat and watched him bend before me to start the conversation.
My Jesus! I felt like entering the ground. His eyes were totally into mine! I just looked down as my level of timidity rose.<br>
"Hey Jenny! Did you really mean what you said?" He asked me looking directly into my eyes.
I couldn't reply that question obviously in my present state. I just maintained silence.
"Jennifer! I need you to tell me to my face. You truly have feelings for me?" He asked again.
I was already shaking and felt my hands vibrating. My heart was in my mouth as I nodded my head quickly to signify 'yes'.<br>
"Okay! It's fine. I wouldn't deny the truth that I really like you so much.... I like you too Jenny. But, you know that you're like a sister to me.... Please, I do not want you to feel bad...we can work this out together...I mean we are in this together and I promise not to let another ear hear this...I promise you." He said softly.
While he spoke to me, I got Goosebumps all over my body and was slightly feeling on top of the world. At least, he likes me.<br>
He embraced me, giving me his words that we were going to work it together.
To be candid, I didn't fully understand what he meant when he said we were going to work it together. I wasn't sure if he was ready to love me the way I love him and choose me to be his new girlfriend or if he was going to help me stop having the crappy feelings for him.<br>
I just held "I can't deny the truth that I really like you" among all his words.
I held this words, lived with it and allowed it ride me into a tale of mere fantasy.
From that time on, those words energized me and propelled a little boldness in me to relate with him. Although, I also lived in the fear of what it would look like before my elder sister, Rita.
What am I supposed to tell her if she eventually notices us or if Nelson and I start dating?
I saw this question cross my mind every time I related with Nelson.<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ******************************************************<br>
I lived like this with Nelson until my sister noticed our closed gesture when she came home for holiday. She noticed that it was beyond just a normal friendship gesture. She then boldly asked me what was going on between Nelson and I, confessing that she had earlier asked Nelson this and he opened up everything to her.<br>
What!!!!!! My heart was heavy! I was ashamed and felt like a fool before Rita. I couldn't say anything because I had no weapon of defense. Rita was not lying. I truly told Nelson I liked him. <br>
"Beside Jenny, he has a girlfriend now.... Her name is Sarah...she is the daughter of the proprietor of the school he teaches... Her matter prompted me to ask him what he was having with you... See my dear sister, better don't let him fool you... Remember what he did to me and I am not telling you this for you to tell him o... In fact, he pleaded that I shouldn't let you know that I know already" Rita spoke to me in caution. <br>
I slept in anger and in more fears that night. I was practically scared of what was going to happen to me again.
We met in church the next day. I couldn't control my fussed state, especially when he walked passed me.
Definitely, he could perceive a rat around as our eyes met. He already knew what his actions had caused.
After church service, I pretentiously changed my disposition and approached him.
"Good evening bro Nelson... please, I want to see you"<br>
"Good afternoon dear, how are you?  Alright, let's see after everyone gets outside" He replied.
We finally had the time to talk outside the church. I was ready to pour my angry mind on him.
"So you told Rita everything? I felt like a fool before her when she asked me, I couldn't even defend myself. At least, even if she eventually knew about us, it should be coming from me, not you. You promised to keep this between us!"<br>
 I said to him rushing my words.<br>
He sighed and held my hand.<br>
"Jenny! I'm really sorry for the hurt I cost you. God knows I like you so much and would date you if I had the chance to. Your sister was mature enough to comprehend our close gesture and so she asked me... I had to tell her for our own good. See babe! I'd date you over and over again if I ever had the chance to".<br>
At that moment, my anger melted gradually and my Goosebumps rose again as I began to consider him.
"It's fine! No problem. Please don't let her know I told you all this" I said calmly.<br>
"AhnAhn!! Common, I don't talk like that... This was needful and I had to let it out" He replied.
"Alright! Goodnight then" I said and left with spaces in my heart.<br>
Why?
One, I still loved him. Two, He has a girlfriend now. Three, My sister knows about my feelings for him. Four, I didn't even know if he told my sister that he liked me too.
What was I supposed to do?<br>
Shutting down my feelings for him was the last thing I had the ability to do. Even when I wished the feelings would just vanish, it wouldn't.<br>
I continued to live like that, loving him while he had a girlfriend and slightly hoping that he would be mine someday. <br>
Funny right? I refused to tell myself that I was jealous of his relationship.
Days went ahead, we still got relating the way we use to. It got to a time that I thought he was just trying to play along because he felt pity for me.<br>
I so hated to be a subject of pity. He had once taught me to hate that. 
" Jenny! Never you allow yourself become a subject of pity... you're a child of God and you're strong!" These words, he had once said to me.<br>
I erased that thought and still trusted that he like me and would have me be his girlfriend soon.
My family moved from Lagos State to our own house in Ogun State. <br>
It was really so hard for me to accept that I was going to be far from Nelson. Fortunately for me, I still had the tendency of staying in Lagos during weekdays because I was working as a teacher in my mom's school in Lagos. I had written my first jamb and post - jamb, but wasn't chosen by the tertiary institutions I picked. I enrolled and sat for another jamb the time came. While I waited for the result, i continued to work as a teacher and started staying at my aunt's place by weekdays. So, I leave for my house by weekend. It really profited me more because Nelson was also close to my aunt and usually come visiting a lot.<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * **************************************************<br>
One faithful day after I got back from work, I met him in my aunt's house. We got conversing as he told me something that got me really surprised.<br>
"Jenny! Sarah and I are no longer dating...I broke up with her!" He said succinctly.
I was flabbergasted.<br>
"Wow!  What happened?" I asked.<br>
"I can't continue with those unfit behaviors she displays. Since she got into the polytechnic, she suddenly changed from the decent girl I knew her to be. Honestly Jenny, I tried fighting this action of mine before making it happen, I severally told her that I wasn't comfortable with her indecent way of life and that we might not go on with the relationship if she continues like that, but, it looked like I was just a sounding brass to her, she didn't change. There was nothing I didn't do for her to change, I even involved her mom. See Jenny, We are done" He spoke as someone free from a burden.<br>
"Hmmmmn! It's well! But really, you two could have still worked this out" I replied.
I sincerely wasn't happy about the scenario. I couldn't just point out the reason.
 Even though I loved Nelson and wanted him to be mine. I couldn't still explain why I was uncomfortable with the news.<br>
I even said to myself that even if Nelson asked me to be his girlfriend at that time, I wasn't sure that I was going to give him a yes as an answer.
 My mind floundered in uncertainty.
Really, I had been living an uncertain life since I fell in love with Nelson.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *********************************************************
An issue rose up in my family that really caused a lot of damages. How my Father knew about Nelson and I, left more places for uncertainty in me. I was just surprised when my mom called me and started interrogating me. 
"Jenny! Are you having anything with Nelson?  Your dad was just talking, he said you called yourself a Christian, you don't miss church programmes, yet you asked a guy to be your boyfriend. He even talked about the gift we bought for Nelson to compensate him for being your lesson coach."<br>
My mom and I for Nelson a little gift after I wrote my WAEC, to compensate him for his act of volunteering to be my lesson coach. Only my sister Rita, had the tendency to know about this, because Nelson was her friend too and he must have told her that we got it for him.<br>
"AhnAhn! But, how did daddy knew that we got him a gift?" I asked my mom with surprised look on my face.
"Hmmmm! I don't know o. But, it must be someone from this house" She replied.<br>
I thought so well about it and never chose to believe that Rita could have done that. I mean, she was my closest siblings. We were obviously like close and shared burdens together.<br>
This matter resulted to a huge clash between my parents. It even involved the pastorate of my church because my dad told them everything.<br>
This was how I started to journey in more despair. I wasn't free at all both at home and in church.
What was I supposed to tell the pastorate?
Lies? <br>
Definitely no!
When Nelson heard about all this, he was troubled. He felt like taking himself out of the scenario because he received severe warnings from his aunty that he was living with, to stay away from me and cut off any additional relationship he had with me apart from being a church member. The news went fast to the church.
During this time, I really broke down emotionally, intellectually and spiritually. I couldn't focus on myself, my family and even God.<br>
I had the burden of shame tied around my neck when I approached the church.
Nelson stopped talking to me like he always did. I knew that we were meant to give ourselves space as the situation was. But, it was so difficult for me because I had already placed Nelson as my confidant. I needed the most at that time.<br>
Unfortunately, it was a fake reality for me.
Nelson went back to becoming an elder brother to me. I wasn't satisfied with the attitude though because the crappy feelings were still intact. Lol!<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ************************************************ <br>
Months passed away, we got over the issue. The rumor reduced. People stopped talking about it. 
I was set to go to school because I had already checked my jamb result and Post Utme and then I was provided admission into the tertiary institution I picked.
Regardless of what had happened in the past, I acted like they never happened and was still in love with Nelson without even permitting my happiness.<br>
A day before the day I was supposed to leave for school, I moved my luggage to his house because his house was closer to the market where I could board a bus. The next day, my mom and I came to get the luggage. I met him, he embraced me and casually bided my mom and I goodbye.<br>
I got to school and Nelson was so much engrossed in my mind. I waited for his call, but waited in vain. My day was never complete without his thought flying through my mind. I would even call him, but will get discouraging response. I noticed that he wasn't interested in relating with me the way I expected, I tried my best to let school engagement make me forget him. The situation was really tiring.
However, it worked partially. But, when I went home when the ASSU strike commenced, my healing and liberty came covered with agony as it clothing.<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *******************************************************<br>
A new year approached. I was January and I was invited for a friend's birthday party. I went with a friend to the birthday party. As we got there, we met Nelson as the anchor of the birthday party. 
I also met a lady whom I had once heard him talk out severally.<br>

As we celebrated, my mind flipped as Nelson spoke.<br> 
Being conscious of his move, I noticed that he already had a new girlfriend and she was right here in the party.
To my greatest surprise, it was the same lady I heard him talk about severally.
I was pained and totally lost strength. The birthday party immediately looked like a burial ceremony before me.
I had to inform the friend I came with that I was going to leave.<br>
I lied that I had something to attend to. So, I left.<br>
As I walked through the road, my heart was like it was totally against me. I felt pulverized.
I shed unworthy tears and could sense that my heart was bleeding too.<br>
I never even had the courage to tell it to the greatest comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom my lord Jesus gave me.
My heart was completely lost and when it failed me completely, God in his infinite love, led me to call a close friend of mine, Lillian. I called Lillian, cried out to her and opened up everything to her.
Fortunately for me, Lillian was truly a God sent. She spoke some words of encouragement, told me to pray in the spirit for a while.<br>
"Lillian! I can't even pray in the spirit right now" I said to her in tears.
I was presently travailing in agony and brokenness. All my soul was crying out for was HELP! HELP!! HELP!!!.
I debased myself and said "why am I always the one treated this way?
Lillian encouraged me and promised to pray for me.
She checked on me, followed me up and introduced me to a forum that was guidance for building godly relationships. I joined the forum and started to learn about godly relationships.
Sincerely, it was a hard time for me. But, while I learnt, God taught me to depend on his strength. 
Even as I began to learn God's mind about relationships, I released my burdens to him. I mean, God's knowledge took away the burdens.<br>
God helped me to be a little far from Nelson.  He erased the crappy feelings and made Nelson appear normal to me.
My liberty came by God's grace. I could never have believed that Nelson would just become normal to me. 
For this reason, I got to know that, what I called love was a mere fantasy. 
Why?
This is because, God is the full expression of what we call love. He is not an author of confusion. He is light and in him there's no darkness, no variableness or shadow of turning.<br>

THE END<br>

Note: God makes perfection out of mistakes too and when we overcome trials, it a sign that our future is safe.
Also, hold on to your brethren in the faith. They are part of your life too.
