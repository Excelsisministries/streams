            <p> I was born on a cold rainy morning right in my father’s sitting room. Needless to say nobody was expecting me that early especially my mom who at that time had been deep into her study of Greek mythology.  According to her, everything had happened in a blur. She had yelled for my dad who had yelled back, after a couple of yells,they had managed the delivery between them before my dad could get her to the hospital. Right there, on that blood soaked floor, she had some sort of epiphany and decided to name me, ATHENA. <br>
Twenty one years later and I had to explain at least twice daily why a dark skinned girl from Enugu state was named after an ancient Greek goddess. <br>


</p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/restored.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>“Hello.” said the young lady easing herself into the seat beside me.
“Hi.” I answered nonchalantly, not bothering to put down my worn out copy of “Tess  of D’ubervilles.”Maybe she would go away.
“Tess of D’uberviles,  huh? I found it intriguing.” <br>
“Yeah.”  I said, lowering my head down to continue reading. I wasn’t much for conversations and I didn’t trust girls yet. Before long, I was so wrapped up in Tess’ mess that I forgot entirely that she was still there.<br>
 “Athena.”<br>
My enlarged eyes probably gave my surprise away. Well it was surprising that she knew my name. Nobody knew my name. 
“Athena, I would really love to speak with you please.” Rolling my eyes slightly, I put my book down and met her gaze fully for the first time. She had pretty eyes and her nose seemed to a little bent, but other than that, her face was quite generic.
“How can I help you?”<br>
“I know that this might be the last thing you want to hear today, particularly from a stranger but I just need you to know that Mmayen has forgiven you. She wants you to know that she holds no grudges.”<br>
The blood drained from my face as everywhere suddenly lost focus. After many years of convincing myself that I didn’t care if Mmayen ever forgave me. But could it be? It had been so many years ago and I hadn’t seen Mmayen since my mom had come to take me after my uncle died. One look at me and my mother had known that I had something to do with it. The only thing she ever said was,
“In consolation, neither your dad nor I loved him very much.” I had desperately wanted to talk to somebody to explain myself, to talk about how I was feeling and what had really happened but my mum had demons of her own.<br>
 “Athena. I don’t know how painful everything has been but I want you to know that God is not angry at you.” 
The sound of my mirthless laughter startled her. I wondered how fast she would run if I began to read out my sins. I picked up my novel. At least Tess was like me, she knew when a young, beautiful child becomes a monster and she didn’t judge. I needed to get away from this girl. Packing my stuff, I hurriedly made my way out of the cafe. I was close to the door when I heard her say,
“There are NO unconventional sins Athena. None. And he has forgiven all.” Even though it seemed as though I had left her behind, I felt something unraveling, something I was very sure I wouldn’t be able to stop.<br>
“Guy how far now? We no dey see you for area again. See as you don lean finish.”<br>
Lawal smiled at the guy and extended his hand for a shake. He didn’t really recognize the guy but he knew he must have known him from back home, which was surprising because home was a long distance from here. He didn’t feel like talking at all this morning. Yesterday night was one of those bad nights. He didn’t have them often but it was so hard these days, so hard to keep the pain at bay. <br>
“Guy, wetin you dey think na.”<br>
Lawal snapped back from his reverie. He really needed to get rid of this guy. He didn’t want to talk about home. Not with the pain it brought. He had burnt his bridges; there was no turning back now. The guy was still talking. Rubbing his aching temples, he tried to think of an excuse when he saw himself being patted affectionately on the shoulder by a smiling girl.<br>
“Where have you been? We are almost late.  We need to leave now. Like right now!” Lawal had never seen the girl before but before he knew it, she had pulled him away from the guy with her surprisingly strong grip.<br>
“You’re welcome.” She winked when they were out of earshot. <br>
“I’m sorry but do we know each other?”<br>
“I recognized the signs. You needed saving from that guy. Shifting feet, fake smiles, you know.”<br>
Lawal laughed till he had to stop to catch his breath. <br>
“I guess I should go now. See you…”<br>
Catching himself, he grabbed her elbow. His laughing must have embarrassed her because she was frowning now. He just had never had anybody rescue him like that before.<br>
 “Hi, I am Lawal. What’s your name?”<br>
“Athena.” She let out reluctantly.<br>
“Goddess of wisdom and battle strategy, Hmmm.”<br>
“Actually no, I am not a goddess of anything. I am just me.”<br>
“Right,Please can I buy breakfast?”<br>
“Look Lawal, what I did, it’s not a big deal. I just know how hard it is for people to leave you alone in this life,that is why I helped you. I don’t really want any…”<br>
“Just breakfast please, Athena. Please.”<br>
Lawal was not one to be free with strangers but he just needed a diversion from everything that was going on in his mind at this time. Thinking about home now was too painful; it was a luxury he could only afford when he was alone. His mind flashed back to the call he had received from his mom about a week ago.<br>
“Hello, Lawal speaking. Who is…”<br>
“Lawal, I had to go a long distance to make this call from a pay phone. It is your mother. My son, I can’t stay long, I just need you to know that I have wired some money to you.  Please reconsider, please come home. Please…” <br>
“Earth to Lawal!Are you crying?”<br>
The laughter that came out of Lawal was so hoarse that it must have given him away.<br>
“I’m fine Athena.” He liked the fact that she didn’t press. They started to talk and didn’t stop until it was half past twelve. It was Athena who noticed the time.<br>
“Maybe we ought to finish up our food now. So you could go to where you need to be.”<br>
The truth was Lawal didn’t have any place to be. Since arriving Enugu town, he had tried to get a job but nothing was working out. Every time he had prayed for a way out, he could hear that singular command ringing on the inside of him, the one that told him to “wait”. How long was he supposed to sleep in cheap smelly hotels and stroll around town. But there was no way he would tell Athena that, he didn’t know if he would ever see her again, however the last thing he needed right now was a young  girl feeling sorry for him. She was saying something to him.<br>
“I asked where you were going to. I want to know if our routes are connected. I can drop you off.”<br>
“Err,well, thing is, I don’t really have where to go.” The look on Athena’s face betrayed the thought he knew must be going through her mind.<br>
“What do you mean?” So Lawal told her everything.<br>
“I had to leave home. It was either that or give up my new found faith. My dad was the Imam of our district central mosque. Right after I became a Christian, the pressure on him to put me back in line became unbearable. At first, he pleaded with me, promised to send me abroad and all that. I couldn’t do it. I tried but I couldn’t just lie about my faith anymore. At first he began to ignore me and separate my siblings from me. My youngest sister, Halima, she is just five; she didn’t understand what was happening. Then he moved me out of his house to the boy’s quarter. One night, he came home and gave me a choice to change my mind. I didn’t. He threw me out and told me never to darken his doorsteps until I came to my senses. I found some money in one of the bags though.” The shrill sound of Athena’s phone startled them both.  She rolled her eyes slightly before answering.<br>
“Athena.”<br>
“Athennaaa, this is your aunt Maggie, where are you?<br>
“Yes auntie, what is it?”
“My dear, I’m so sorry, it’s your mother honey, she… you have to come right now…” Then the line went dead.<br>
*********************************************************************************<br>
My mind tried to process what I had just heard on the phone. Something bad had happened to Jolene. I always called my mother by her name in my head. I didn’t exactly love my mother but I didn’t want her dead. I didn’t even know whose heart it was that was slamming in my chest. I didn’t know my heart still processed emotion.  A coldblooded killer but here I was, perspiring and trembling at the thought of losing the only living relative I had left.  I noticed Lawal waving his hands in my face. What was so bad that aunty Magggie couldn’t tell me over the phone? Perhaps she had been shot by some careless hoodlum, or ran over by a car or maybe worse, thoughts kept coming, each scarier than the last. My heart was racing now more than ever, I reached over for a glass of water but next thing I knew was Lawal helping me up to my feet.<br>
“Athena, what happened? You look so shaken. Where are your keys? Can you give me your address; let me drive you home please I beg you.”<br>
Lawal must have driven very fast because before I knew it we were at my house. Aunty Maggie gave him one tired grateful nod and turned her attention to me.<br>
“Athena Nwadike Philips, where in heaven’s name did you drive off to this time? You know this woman needs you. All you care about is yourself. You think if you allow this woman die, you will have any one else?”<br>
Sighing inwardly, I relaxed. If Aunty Maggie could nag, whatever had happened had not been life threatening. I didn’t want her to go on and on especially not in front of Lawal.<br>
“Aunty I am sorry, I just needed some fresh air…”<br>
“Don’t tell me that nonsense! See what your useless fresh air has caused. If this woman had died kwa? She fell from the stool in the kitchen.  What if she had not called me? What if I was out of town? You this useless…”<br>
‘AUNTY IT IS ENOUGH! I NEEDED TO GET AWAY FROM HER, FROM ALL THIS. I WAS NOT BORN SO I CAN BABYSIT AN ALCHOHOLIC.”<br>
“This witch, you are shouting on me. You want to kill my sister the way you killed your uncle abi?”<br>
Aunty Maggie’s eyes widened in shock as her hands flew over her mouth, she had not intended to say it but the deed was done. 
“Nne, Athena, I didn’t mean. Your mother…’ Her voice trailed off as she burst into tears. Tears calculated at manipulating me. I shrugged off her hand and walked into the room where my mother was sleeping. Her face was the very picture of torment. She kept thrashing about whilst mumbling incoherent words. For a moment I felt strongly the urge to wrap the pillow round her head and suffocate the little life that was left. Then I lowered my head and began to sob. I thought about my father, the light of my life who had died and taken my mother’s spirit with him, I thought about the first few weeks in Calabar before my uncle began to sneak into my room at night. I didn’t even know the way out of the torment anymore. I felt strong hands grip my shoulder tenderly. Lawal! In my pain, I had temporarily forgotten all about him. <br>
“Athena, it’s okay. Stop crying, please.”<br>
“Thank you Lawal, I think you should go now.”<br>
I’m not going anywhere.”<br>
“Look here mister! I don’t need your help. Leave please. I don’t need you pitying me or looking down your nose at me. Please just leave.”<br>
Lawal saw by her turned back that she was resolute; he however had no intention of leaving her here. It wasn’t just Athena’s tears, something was pulling him to this house. <br>
“Can I at least have your number? Please, I would love to check on you later.”<br>
“No.”<br>
Lawal walked out of the house and was almost halfway through the street when he heard it.<br>
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?<br>
“Abba, frankly, I am not in the mood. You heard her, she doesn’t want me there. What do you want me to do?”
GO TO THE HOUSE AND SIT AT HER FRONT DOOR.<br>
“I will not.  No way, everything is just crazy!” But Lawal found himself moving back towards the house. The worst that could happen was that she’d throw him out again.<br>
Athena rubbed her temples as she leaned against the sink. She could deal with aching bones, what she couldn’t manage anymore was the pain eating her up, maybe one day she’d just drop dead from shame. The horrible stench coming from the dustbin brought Athena back. She had to take it out before morning if she didn’t want to wake up to rat infestation. Picking up the thrash, she walked out of the kitchen towards the front door.<br>
Of all days for Abba to keep him outside, it had to be a cold windy day like this one. Never mind that he hadn’t had anything to eat since the morning, or that he had to endure strange looks from passersby.<br>
I didn’t realize my mouth was hanging open until Lawal walked up to her.<br>
“What are you doing here?’<br>
“I needed to be sure that you were okay. Besides, I’ve got nowhere to go, remember?’ He let out a rueful laugh. Truth was, if Abba had not insisted he would be far away from here.
I couldn’t believe my ears but I knew genuine concern when I saw it. It was the same look I had seen many times in my father’s eyes in the past when he spoke to my mother. I didn’t even know if he realized that he was shivering. I was torn between inviting Lawal in and sending him away again. I had lived my life by myself for so long, convinced that there was nobody I could trust. Maybe Mmayen but evenMmayen in the end had hated me, Precious Mmayen. <br>
THERE ARE NO UNCONVENTIONAL SINS.  <br>
I winced as I remembered the girl I had met at the cafe some days back, the one who had tried to feed me false hope about Mmayen.
“Athena?Are you okay? You look very tired.”<br>
Lawal rolled his eyes inwardly, even him could hear how pathetic he sounded. 
Now what Abba? What do I say to her?<br>
I didn’t know what my mother’s reaction would be but I couldn’t leave him out in the cold. What could I do?
Jolene awakened with a start as light filtered into her room. There was a compress on her head. She must have been dreaming again. The events of the previous day were a blur in her mind. Pain shot up her spine as she struggled to sit up. How long had she been out? She had to talk to Athena, or maybe her only daughter had run away again. Carefully she managed to get up to her feet. Maybe she would be able to do a few things for herself this morning, that way she won’t feel so useless. She wasn’t paralyzed, at least not in her body but the thought of doing anything overwhelmed her. Actions were for living things. She felt dead. The pallor on her face was beginning to terrify even her. She’d plead with Athena to take out her mirror. Right now, she focused her energy on getting to the kitchen to get herself some water; maybe she would be able to get more than three words out of Athena.
Lawal had just finished rinsing out the plate Athena served him breakfast with and was wiping his hands on his trousers when he felt someone’s eyes at the back of his head.<br>
“Athena, is that you? Thanks for…”<br>
“Whooarrree you?’<br>
Lawal found himself staring into the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen. He knew at once that this had to be Athena’s mother. She looked like death warmed over but he could tell that she was once been a very beautiful woman.<br>
“Good morning ma. I am a friend of…”<br>
He was cut short by Athena’s cold look. But the look wasn’t directed at him, it was directed at her mother.<br>
“Lawal is a friend of mine. He was just about leaving.” Athena’s mom brightened up.  Lawal guessed Athena had not brought any friends home in a long time.<br>
“Actually, err, no…I would like to stay a bit if you don’t mind.”<br>
“I do.” Her hands were folded now but Lawal could feel some kind of script playing out. Now that he had seen Athena’s mother, he really couldn’t leave without talking to her.<br>
“Let the young man stay Athena. Please, I would like to meet your friend.”<br>
“And Since when have you been interested in anything that I do? All you do is drink and cry. And of course betray my secrets.”
“Athena I was worried…” But it was too late. Athena had bolted out of the kitchen.<br>
“What’s gotten into that girl lately? She’s like a time bomb waiting to explode. I know she blames me for a lot of things. I failed her.” Lawal felt his eyes tear up as he looked at her. She was looking at her hands now but he could see the tears drop.  Athena was acting like a temperamental teenager but he could tell that she was reacting from wounds, wounds that she blamed this woman for. <br>
“I just needed some water. Excuse me.” <br>
“You can talk to me ma, I know you don’t know me but I’d listen ma. Please.” <br>
Lawal handed her a glass of water as she sat at the dining.<br>
“You know Athena didn’t hate me in the beginning. She adored me. We used to read to each other till one of us fell asleep. You know growing up, I went through many phases. I didn’t know my mother, I was raised by my father who did a good job but you know, I never knew what it was like to have a mom. When I married Marcus, Athena’s father, everybody in his family complained. They said I was still too much of a girl to be married but Marcus married me anyway. I wanted to prove myself to Marcus, to everyone and so I started activism. That was when the late nights started. The back aches too. Because I was getting attention and being applauded, I didn’t mind. In the beginning, Marcus and Athena were very supportive; they came to every rally and protest. I didn’t even know when I started to change. I was rarely home, I started missing Athena’s school events; I started to drink too, just a little. It helped calm me before any major protest. I started to notice that we started to pick our causes, the ones that would get us more popular, more celebrated. I would have done anything to feel valuable at the time. My husband warned me that I was acting out of insecurity that I was becoming a stranger to my daughter. But I was too drunk on the acclaims to stop. After a while the activism stopped being about the rights of the people we were fighting for, it became about me. My pressure to be somebody’s hero and for a while I was, until Marcus died…”<br>
She was crying again. Lawal didn’t know how best to soothe her. He prayed quietly under his breath.<br>
Abba, what can I do? This woman is hurting. I don’t have the words.<br>
She continued in a toneless voice, “I had agreed to pick Athena up that day. Marcus had a plane to catch because the company he was working with at the time had sent him to represent them at a regional stakeholders meeting. Typical of my behaviour then, after a successful and well attended rally, my friends and I decided to celebrate. I forgot the time. I didn’t remember anything about Athena until I dug out my phone from the purse and saw that Marcus had been calling me for about two hours. By the time I called him back, he told me he was on his way to the airport. He was driving with high speed because picking Athena up had caused him to be late. He pleaded with me to go home and stay with our daughter, my daughter. Then he hung up, that was the last time I heard from him. His body was found by the side of the road. Some trailer had brake issues…” <br>
She was crying again, sobbing this time. Watching her fingers drag her hair out broke his heart. He reached over but she yanked his hand away. Shame had its firm grip on mother and daughter. <br>
“That was when Athena started to hate me. She was convinced that it was my fault. Can you blame her? My whole world tipped on its axis. Weeks after the funeral, she still didn’t speak to me, she didn’t go to school, all she did was sit by the window and call out his name. Then I really started to drink. Three months later, Marcus’ people came for Athena. They suggested a change of environment. Athena looked so happy about it, I didn’t have the heart to refuse, though everything in me screamed out to the contrary. Those years without her were the loneliest of my life but I was too wrapped up in my own grief to see how much my baby was suffering.”<br>
Jolene couldn’t sit anymore. What was she doing telling a stranger her story. She carried her glass of water to the kitchen. She could hear the young man following her. <br>
“One day I received a call from my sister in law, she told me to come and carry my witch home. Apparently her husband was dead and Athena had killed him. She didn’t give me the details. Athena never spoke about it. The girl I brought back home was not my daughter.  I triedbut  always met a wall. Her uncle had a daughter, Mmayen. I don’t know what happened between them but every night Athena would dream and she would cry in her sleep, she would say, ‘I am sorry Mmayen’ over and over. I started drinking more because I didn’t know how to handle my guilt, her guilt and everything that had happened. I became an alcoholic. Then all kinds of health issues set in. Athena had to leave the only thing that mattered to her again so she could take care of me. Her job as a studio photographer, she tried to hire nannies but I didn’t want them. So now she hates me. If she brought a nanny now, maybe I would not mind. I pray to die every night but even death mocks me.” <br>
An idea occurred to Lawal then. A bizarre one but even as he thought about it, he could feel peace in his heart about it.
“You can tell Athena to hire me, I’ll be your nanny ma.” <br>
“Yeah right, I can just see you moping vomit off the floor and cooking.” <br>
Jolene and Lawal turned to stare at Athena. They had not seen her walk in. How much had she overheard? 
“Athena, you can go back to work, as you know, I don’t have a job or a house for that matter. I’d be delighted to work here.”
Hope welled up in Athena’s heart, just four days ago, her ex-boss had told her that he was still interested in working with her. Could Lawal really be the solution?’ How did she know if she could trust him?
“Athena I know it seems unlikely but please you can trust me. Please.” <br>
“Okay.” She said smiling. Jolene smiled too. It had been so long since both smiled but Lawal intended to change that. Now he knew why all those years his mother had forced him to cook were important. <br>
Abba had a good sense of humour, not only had he provided a home for him, he also made sure he had a job too. As a dignified house boy though  <br>
Over the next few days, Lawal settled into Athena’s home. He knew he had work to do but he could feel Abba telling him to wait. Wait and love. After chores each evening, Athena’s mother would sit by the front door and talked to him. He listened because that was all Abba would have him do for now. One evening as he sat out listening to her talk about her life before Athena was born, he heard himself say,<br>
“You are altogether beautiful my love. There is no flaw in you.”
“What did you say to me?’ <br>
Lawal could not imagine what would have possessed him to say such a thing. Well he knew, but he didn’t appreciate it. The poor woman had run into the house weeping profusely. Because Abba decided to be poetic!<br>
Abba!What now? She’s going to think all sorts of horrible things about me. Of all the convicting lines you could have used?
He saw Athena parking her car in the driveway.<br>
“Hello Athena. How are you?’<br>
Athena looked at him with guarded eyes, over the last week she had been acting distant towards him.<br>
“Look who has my time today ooo.”<br>
“Haba,Athena it’s not like that o… It’s just you know I have work to do for your mom…”<br>
Athena side stepped him and walked into the house. Pouring herself a cup of Yoghurt, she leaned over the kitchen counter.
“You know what? I should never have brought you home.” Downing the yogurt left in her cup, she backed him and rinsed out the cup. When she turned, Lawal was smiling<br>
“You know Athena, you can share with mumsy. I am enough to go around.”<br>
Athena laughed then and for the first time ever Lawal found himself thinking of how beautiful she was. Shaking his head, he snapped out of his thoughts.<br>
“Well, excuse me ma. I have a few chores.”<br>
Athena’s phone rang just as her mother came in to the kitchen. Lawal had noticed that the two had been getting along better though they were still far cry from being friends. Maybe everything would be fine now. <br>
“Hello, who is this?’ He could hear Athena’s voice faintly. The next thing he heard was a thud. Athena was on the floor, unconscious.<br>
“Hello, who is this?” A long pause followed his question. <br>
“Where is Athena. It’s Mmayen.”<br>
I could hear Lawal answering my call. NO! He couldn’t speak to Mmayen. Nobody could.<br>
“I’m awake. Give me my phone.”<br>
“I am not sure that’s a good idea. You passed out just now.” <br>
“I am fine.”<br>
“Hello, Mmaayen, Mmayen. Are you there?”<br>
“Yes I am here, Athena. We have to see. I came to Enugu to see you. Where do you stay?”<br>
Lawal didn’t know what to make of the new turn of events. He had been praying for Athena and her mother since he heard their story and he desperately hoped that whatever was happening now was part of Abba’s plan. Athena disappeared right after she hung up, leaving him alone with her mother. Lawal was still embarrassed from what had transpired earlier that evening.<br>
“Can I ask you something Lawal, earlier today, what made you say that to me?”<br>
“Frankly ma, I don’t know. I just found myself saying it. Rest assured that…” She cut him off with a wave of her hand. <br>
“I reacted that way because my husband used to say that to me every night. Every blessed night, whether he was at home or out of town. I struggled with so much insecurity then but he wasn’t just talking about my looks. If there was ever one person that completely accepted me, it was Marcus. He accepted all that I was and loved me to a fault. I just wish I had known that…” Her voice trailed off as she covered her eyes with her hand.<br>
“He loves you still, ma.  He wants, he need you to know that. And he wants you to forgive yourself.”<br>
“How do you know that?” Her voice had turned aggressive. Abba help please, help me get to her.<br>
“Because I can hear him ma.”<br>
“You expect me to believe you communicate with the dead. I haven’t been a Christian for a long time but I know that is wrong.”
“When Christians die ma, they don’t necessarily die, we refer to it as them “sleeping”. Sometimes God will allow us know what they are saying so we can be free from torment.<br>
Lawal watched her bury her head into her frail hands, he could feel Abba prodding him to continue.<br>
“That’s not all, Abba, that is what I call God, Abba says that he misses you. He said I should tell you that he misses you reading to him, writing for him. He says he wants more love letters ma. He wants me to let you know that his love for you goes beyond your performance and your role. He just wants you back ma.”<br>
Jolene looked at Lawal with tears rolling down her face, there was no way this young man could have known so much about her relationship with God except God had told him, not even Athena knew because she wasn’t born at the time. She was tired of everything, the pain, the shame, the guilt. She wanted it to end. She had prayed for death but instead God had sent healing. He had sent friendship, he had sent a way back. Gratefulness swept through her as she gave in to the weeping. Lawal put his hands over hers and this time she didn’t draw back, there was strength in the young man’s hands. As he wrapped her in his arms, she could feel power coursing through her being. God was here. Her father was here.<br>
******************************************************************************<br>
My heart beat quickened as I watched Mmayen approach. She had grown into a very beautiful woman. I couldn’t look her in the eye.
“Athena. It’s good to see you.” Mmayensaid as she wrapped me in a warm hug. To say I was surprised was to say the least. Driving up here, my mind had imagined a whole lot of things but none had prepared me for this. I couldn’t bring myself to hug her though, I was too nervous.<br>
“Do you mind if we sit out at Dominos?” I nodded absent mindedly.<br>
Mmayen ordered Fiery Suya pizza and sat down across from me. Once our pizza was served, she started talking.
“Athena, growing up, my father was my everything. I didn’t care for my mother much but he meant the world to me. As an only child of course, I was the sole object of his affection. When you came to live in my house, at first I was glad. I was excited that I finally had a friend, a sister. You remember how we used to do everything together. Then you started to abuse me. At first I was terrified but later on I didn’t care. We were friends right? Then I started to notice how my dad always looked at you. I wasn’t the only precious one anymore. That was when I began to hate you. One night, I couldn’t sleep so I came to your room. I had become addicted to what you did to me. Then I saw my father in your room. I had run back to my room crying. I couldn’t tell my mom… You were abusing me and now had started to seduce my dad, that was what I thought…”<br>
I couldn’t look into Mmayen’s eyes. I wanted to explain that it wasn’t entirely my fault. That the maid had also…
“Then one day I came back from school and saw my mother crying, then she said you had killed my father. “
“It was an accident Mmayen,I was in the kitchen washing plates with Caro when your dad walked in and drove Caro out. He started to touch me then. I begged him to stop, he slapped me. The next thing I knew, I swung the spatula in my hand on his head. Earlier Caro had spilled water on the floor, in the course of the struggle, he hit my head on one of the kitchen cabinets. I didn’t know what I was doing, I hadn’t intended to kill him. The next thing I knew was I hit him with the pestle and he slipped and fell. I didn’t even know he would die. It wasn’t until I saw where his head had hit that…”
Mmayen put her hands over Athena’s. She could see the girl’s pain. God help me, help us. Please.
“Athena, it’s okay. I forgive you. It wasn’t your fault…”<br>
I started crying right there, I didn’t care that there were people around and looking at us. All these years the nightmare that haunted me was finally been unraveled.<br>
“Mmayen, I am sorry about everything. Caro she… she, she used to abuse me, I didn’t even notice when I started to like it. By then, I felt like damaged goods. Every time in church, I was convinced that I was abnormal, every time the pastor screamed about lesbianism being an unconventional sin.”<br>
“That’s a lie Athena, you are not a lesbian. You were abused. Even if you were, He has forgiven you. He will deliver you. There are no unconventional sins with him. All sin is sin. He wants you.”<br>
The conversation with the girl in the cafe came back to Athena’s mind clearly. <br>
“How do I break free Mmayen? I am so tired of guilt and shame eating me up slowly.”<br>
I listened to Mmayen talk about love, about forgiveness, about God. 
“I’m ready, I’m ready to be close to God. I need this strength you have, please Mmayen.”
Mmayen’s face lit up like a Christmas tree. She had hoped and prayed that when she finally talked to Athena, God would open her heart and heal her wounds.<br>
“Well first, we’ll pray…”<br>
*************************************************************************<br>
Lawal smiled as he heard Athena and her mother arguing in the parlour. The past few weeks had been refreshing. Athena no longer walked around like she was carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders. Jolene on the other hand was smiling more. Yesterday she had put on make-up. She had also confided in him that she had not touched a single bottle since the day they talked. Athena was always asking him questions about God and had started attending a Methodist church nearby.<br>
“Lawal!”<br>
“Yes ma!Coming ma…”<br>
“Sit down with us a bit, the plates can wait. Please.” Smiling, he sat across from Athena.<br>
 He thought about how the past few weeks had turned out, the joy that filled his heart was overwhelming. Athena was smiling at him now, she looked away when their eyes met. Was she shy? He found himself thinking of her more often than normal these days, Maybe. He collected himself. Nobody could heal and bring together like Abba could. Nobody could ease the pain and loneliness of leaving his family like Abba. Maybe one day, he would stand restored like this family, just maybe. He smiled even now as he felt assurance well up within him.
