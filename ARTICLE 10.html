                    <p>Going through life with its different seasons can be quite overwhelming; even the strongest ones
                        would admit to just wanting to buckle under the weight of it all on some days.
                    </p>
                    Life can be hard, intense, demanding, and inexplicable. Sometimes, we go through seasons that keep
                    us awake at night in hope, and other times we struggle to find peace and joy as we push through the
                    routine of our daily lives.

                    </p>
                    Life could also be beautiful, rich and full of happy experiences. Some seasons have us exclaiming to
                    all who would care to listen, "Life's good."
                    </p>
                    No matter how life is going for us, no matter the bends and curves life throws us, no matter the
                    highs and lows, one thing that remains evident is that we don't want to be alone.
                    <p>
                        Nobody wants to be alone and no one wants to have to go through life feeling unloved. As humans,
                        we all crave love and acceptance. We want people to like us, appreciate us and be interested in
                        us. When we are denied these things, life can become unbearable and traumatic.
                    </p>
                    Our heavenly Father who fashioned us knows these things and this is why he has ensured that he fills
                    this void HIMSELF.
                    </P>
                    </P>
                    <img src="images/FATHER'S LOVE.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    </p>
                    The Father has structured our lives in such a way that we would never have to live without love and
                    acceptance. With his many expressions, he draws us in and gives us the security that only a robust
                    love can evoke.
                    </p>
                    In Romans chapter 8, we are reminded about the love of God from the very first verse. It starts,
                    telling us how we would always be loved by him and can never hear him say we have been condemned, it
                    takes us to parts where we are confronted with his fatherly adoption: he calls us sons and tells us
                    that we will never have to be afraid again.
                    </p>
                    His love directs us and sculpts our prayers in his will so we can always have his best. And then it
                    ends with an assurance that we can never lack this love.
                    </p>
                    The love of God is infinite; it cascades from all parts of Him and overshadows all things. The love
                    of God envelops us and shields us from the darts of the evil one.
                    </p>
                    The love of God is relentless in its pursuit; it constantly seeks creative ways to immerse its
                    object in love. The best part of all these is it is tangible.

                    But how can I be aware of this love you're talking about, you may ask?
                    </p>
                    First, you must be a child of God. It's only when your life is surrendered to Christ that you can
                    enjoy and understand his love.
                    </p>
                    Then, you need to constantly affirm your mind by saying
                    </p>
                    "I comprehend with all my brothers and sisters all over the body, the love of Christ."
                    </p>
                    "I interact with the love of God, it enriches and dominates my life. I have a father and he loves to
                    love me."
                    </p>
                    " The Lord loves me with all the love he could possibly can."
                    </p>
                    Statements that like this entrench it in your consciousness that you are a recipient of God's love
                    forever.
                    As you continue to do all these, you'll grow more in the awareness of God's love for you and be
                    empowered to live a victorious Christain life.

                    </p>

                    Let us Pray
                    </P>
                    "Dear Father
                    </P>
                    Thank you for this word you have brought. Help us to live daily in the consciousness of your love.
                    Let us realize just
                    how complete we are in this love. Help us to grow in the knowledge of your love in Jesus' name."
                    </P>
                    Amen.
                    </P>
                    Stay loved!
                    </p>
