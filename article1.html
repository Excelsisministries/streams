            <p>Cold rainy days for me are often the worst. Don't try to link it to some age long trauma or some unpleasant experience, it's simply because the continuous dripping reminds me of how time passes. On days like this, I am forced to do an assessment of my life and it might be no surprise to you right now that I always come up short. As I continue to examine, I come face to face with all the weaknesses I had promised to work on, face to face with all the pain of the past, all the needless suffering that I thought I had forgotten about. Then this goes on for a while till I sink to the floor drowning in my own sorrow. Then I'd reach deep into my heart and bring up all the buried issues, the one I hadn't dared attend to before and wallow in my filth and hurt. Outside this pity party, I'm your everyday regular bubbly girl, the one whose laughter you hear still ringing long after everyone has stopped laughing, yes that's me. Extrovert. Life of the party. Me. Or that used to be me until something changed.</p>
            <p>
              <img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>I don't know when exactly things changed though. If you ask me for a date, I would be as confused as you are but I do know things have changed. You see the thing about healing is that because you still feel spin occasionally at the spot you were hurt, you think nothing has really changed but many times if you're courageous enough to look at that wound, you'd find a beautiful scar. <br></br>
So back to my story, I don't know when things change, I can't give you a climactic moment where I suddenly got "delivered". But here's what I can tell you. I am no longer that girl who sinks into depression on cold rainy days, I no longer attend, sponsor or even participate in pity parties. I no longer sit on my couch for hours writing gloomy stories nor do I write poems whose endings are inevitably sad. I am no longer the girl who wears a hair shirt for things she has been forgiven for. I am no longer the girl who sits in the dark hoping that I have paid penance enough  to be happy again. I don't know when that girl left exactly, but she no longer exists.
Why can't I trace her departure though? Because my healing did not happen suddenly. Layer by layer the lover of my soul provided healing and worked on my wounds until they no longer had the power to be infected by shame and guilt. That girl died slowly but surely. This girl here, she moved!<br></br>
So maybe you're like me, wondering when your healing would come? I'm here to remind you that you have moved. Remember those days when everything you listened to was sad, now you have some happy tunes in there too, you've moved. Remember the days when you couldn't write a happy story no matter how hard you tried? Well now baby, you can't even write a sad story to save your life. And why is this? You've moved! 
The enemy who is a thief would lie to you, he'll tell you you're not getting any better but you have moved! You might not be where you want to be but you definitely are not where you used to be and that is healing! <br></br>

Celebrate your scars, they  aren't reminders of injuries, they are announcements of victories. The victory you have. You are a child of the living God, born because he wanted it and brought it to pass. Nothing created can overwhelm your victory. I just want you to remind you baby that you've moved, you've healed and you're still healing. Scripture assures us that he's willing and able to keep making us move(healing us) until we are perfect. 
So what if you're still like the old me? This is a message to remind you too, that you can move! And you will move! Take those baby steps, pray that honest prayer, let him wrap his hand around you and say,
" You're home, child. And I will never leave you."<br>
As you read this, it is my sincere prayer that you see how far you've come and how much healing he has accomplished. It is a simply a foretaste. Look forward to more. You're loved.
</p>
